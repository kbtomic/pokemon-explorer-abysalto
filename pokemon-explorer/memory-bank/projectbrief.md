# Pokemon Explorer Application - Project Brief

## Project Overview

A modern web application for exploring the Pokemon universe, built with Next.js 15, featuring comprehensive Pokemon data visualization, advanced filtering, and responsive design.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Pokemon Display System

- **Grid Layout**: Display Pokemon in a responsive grid with key information
- **Essential Data**: Image, Name, Types, Basic Stats (HP, Attack, Defense)
- **Modal Details**: Expandable detailed view for comprehensive Pokemon information

### 2. Advanced Filtering System

- **Type Filtering**: Filter by Pokemon types (Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, etc.)
- **Generation Filtering**: Filter by Pokemon generation
- **Stats Range Filtering**: Filter by stat ranges (Attack, Defense, Speed)
- **Abilities Filtering**: Filter by Pokemon abilities
- **Name Search**: Real-time search functionality by Pokemon name

### 3. Sorting Capabilities

- **Alphabetical**: Sort by Pokemon name (A-Z, Z-A)
- **Total Power**: Sort by combined stat totals
- **Generation**: Sort by generation number
- **Individual Stats**: Sort by specific stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
