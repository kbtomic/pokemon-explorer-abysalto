- **API Integration**: Centralized API client with data transformation layer
- **Performance Strategy**: Image optimization, code splitting, and caching
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges to Address

1. **PokeAPI Rate Limiting**: Need to implement proper request throttling and caching
2. **Large Dataset Handling**: Pokemon list can be extensive, need efficient pagination/virtualization
3. **Image Loading**: Pokemon sprites need optimization for performance
4. **Filter Performance**: Complex filtering logic needs to be optimized
5. **Mobile UX**: Ensuring excellent mobile experience for filtering and browsing

### Design Decisions Pending

1. **Color Scheme**: Pokemon-themed color palette vs. modern neutral design
2. **Typography**: Font choices for headings and body text
3. **Animation Strategy**: Level of animations and transitions to implement
4. **Loading States**: Design for skeleton loading vs. spinner loading
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error message design and placement

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Filter Discoverability**: How to make advanced filters easily discoverable
2. **Search Behavior**: Real-time search vs. search on submit
3. **Modal vs. Page**: Pokemon details in modal vs. dedicated page
