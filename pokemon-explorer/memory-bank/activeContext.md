3. **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, image optimization
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
5. **Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test implementation

## Current Decisions

### Technology Choices Made

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router (confirmed)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 (confirmed)
- **State Management**: Zustand for client state (confirmed)
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state (confirmed)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation (confirmed)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright (planned)

### Architecture Decisions

- **Component Organization**: Atomic design with feature-based grouping
- **State Pattern**: Separation of client state (Zustand) and server state (React Query)
- **API Integration**: Centralized API client with data transformation layer
- **Performance Strategy**: Image optimization, code splitting, and caching
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints

## Active Considerations

### Technical Challenges to Address

1. **PokeAPI Rate Limiting**: Need to implement proper request throttling and caching
2. **Large Dataset Handling**: Pokemon list can be extensive, need efficient pagination/virtualization
3. **Image Loading**: Pokemon sprites need optimization for performance
4. **Filter Performance**: Complex filtering logic needs to be optimized
5. **Mobile UX**: Ensuring excellent mobile experience for filtering and browsing

### Design Decisions Pending

1. **Color Scheme**: Pokemon-themed color palette vs. modern neutral design
2. **Typography**: Font choices for headings and body text
3. **Animation Strategy**: Level of animations and transitions to implement
4. **Loading States**: Design for skeleton loading vs. spinner loading
5. **Error Handling**: User-friendly error message design and placement

### User Experience Considerations

1. **Filter Discoverability**: How to make advanced filters easily discoverable
2. **Search Behavior**: Real-time search vs. search on submit
3. **Modal vs. Page**: Pokemon details in modal vs. dedicated page
4. **Sorting Feedback**: Visual indication of current sort order
5. **Mobile Navigation**: How to handle filters and search on mobile

## Development Environment Status

### Current Setup

- **Node.js**: Compatible version installed
- **Package Manager**: pnpm in use
- **Development Server**: Next.js dev server with Turbopack enabled
- **Code Editor**: VSCode with appropriate extensions assumed
- **Version Control**: Git repository initialized

### Configuration Status

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, basic configuration complete
- **ESLint**: Next.js recommended rules active
- **Tailwind CSS**: Basic configuration with PostCSS integration
- **Prettier**: Not yet configured (pending)
- **Husky/Lint-staged**: Not yet configured (pending)
